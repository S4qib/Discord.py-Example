# Discord.PY-Bot-Example
This is a building block to creating your first bot with discord.py!

# Plans
- I will soon make a open-source public bot made in discord.py which will be maintained unlike this respirotary.
- Making a discord.js example
- A client area made with flask and python which contacts the Pterodactyl API to make servers, create and delete users etc.

# Will this ever be updated?
Probably not unless there is a major discord.py update or there is any issues.
